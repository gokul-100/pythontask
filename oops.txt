Our program around functions i.e blocks of statements that manipulate data
this is called the procedure-oriented probgram

->there is another way of organizing  your program which is  to combine data and functionality and wrap it inside something
called an object this called object oriented program


oop's concept:
->class
->objects
->polymorphism
->encapsulation
->inheritance
->data abstraction

class
->class is collection of objects
->A class is a blueprint for how something should be defined
->classes define the function called methods which identify
the behaviors that an object created from the class can perform
with its data

objects-> objecs are anyithing that has properties and some behaviors
properties of objects ->variables
behavior -> functions of the objects

->the properties that all objects objects have are defined in 
method call __init__()
__init__ sets the initial state of the objects
